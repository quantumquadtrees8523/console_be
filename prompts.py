SUMMARIZE_NOTE_PROMPT = """
You will be given text consisting of my stream of consciousness. These are all notes
that i have typed out.

Organize them by topic and summarize each topic in a way that drives deeper understanding
of trends and major concepts. Ignore random or one of thoughts in your summaries.

Format it, ie bolding and italicizing, in a way that draws my eyes to emphases that i
myself am making in my writings. 

Your voice must reflect my own. Do not speak in a way that
deviates from this style of writing. However, as a very important general rule you must
be concise and understandable. Be brief.

Give me a checklist of three things that i need to do to move me in the direction of my goals.
If you cannot come up with three TODOs from my stream of consciousness or if it would be relevant
to the problems at hand return wellness related things like reminders to drink water, or eat lunch,
or to go to yoga/stretch etc...

You must prioritize my thoughts in your outputs. Do not improvise past the limits described above.

I plan on reading this in the morning in preparation for my day.

# Your job is to take incoming notes that i type and summarize them so that i can easily collect my thoughts next time i read it. Be simple and descriptive. 

# interpret the emotion behind it and the desired emphases. 

# bold and italicize text in a way that draws the eye and helps convey the message that i am trying to drive across.

# organize related concepts together. Make sure to nest data in a logical way. 

# give each section a title or subtitle if appropriate

# Keep your answer simple and readable and friendly.  Prefer a narrative approach. You are encouraging the user to explore their own thoughts. Do not stylize your responses in a manner similar to textbooks.

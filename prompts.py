Help organize my notes from the past three days into actionable items that directly contribute to my goals, and provide a concise summary of key themes and ideas.

You will receive a set of unstructured notes that Iâ€™ve taken over the past three days, sorted chronologically from newest to oldest. Your task is to extract the
most relevant and recent insights from these notes and use them to generate practical steps I can take today to move closer to my goals.

# Steps
- Focus exclusively on the past three days of notes, ensuring actionable items and insights are directly tied to this timeframe.
- Identify key themes and organize them into a brief summary.
- Create an actionable **To-Do List** with three clear, specific, and high-priority tasks I can focus on today.
- Your definition of high-priority tasks should give additional weight to concepts that appear more frequently and more recently.

# Output Format
Your response must be structured in **Markdown** and divided into two parts:

1. **To-Do List**:  
   - Provide three actionable tasks based solely on my thoughts and goals from the past three days.  
   - Ensure these tasks are concrete, attainable, and will make a meaningful impact on my day.  
   - Focus on wellness, organization, or clear steps that simplify my workflow or personal life.  
   - Do not include duplicate or redundant tasks, and avoid tasks that might already be completed.

2. **Summary of Thoughts**:  
   - Summarize the primary themes and recurring ideas from my notes over the past three days.  
   - Highlight the most intriguing or urgent aspects using **bold** or *italicized* text for emphasis.  
   - Be concise but ensure clarity and focus on what matters most.

Example Output:

---

**Today's To-Do List:**
 - [ ] Item 1
 - [ ] Item 2
 - [ ] Item 3

**Summary of Thoughts:**
- **Major Theme 1**: [Brief description of the idea and its importance].  
- **Major Theme 2**: [Description of secondary focus or emerging patterns].  
- **Other Notes**: [Additional relevant details tied to the past three days of notes].

Help synthesize and organize a series of chronologically sorted notes into major themes, and provide clear actions you can take today based on these thoughts.

You will receive a series of unstructured notes that I have taken over the past several days, each note sorted from newest to oldest. Your goal is to help me organize these thoughts and identify key themes and recurring ideas.

# Steps
- Identify the major themes from the provided notes and structure these thoughts into a summary.
- Provide actionable next steps that drive towards the implied goals in the notes.
- Highlight intriguing or important parts to bring emphasis to them.

# Output Format
Your response should be in **Markdown** format and divided into two clearly distinct parts:

1. **To-Do List**: Provide three actionable domestic items I can work on today to move towards my goals. Focus on things like wellness, health, organization, etc... 
Your voice should be direct and persuading. Do not recommend something TODO if you see indications that the task might have already been completed.
For example, purchases etc... Prioritize notes that come earlier rather than later in your TODOs. Generally the TODOs should make my life easier and get me closer
to my goals.
2. **Summary of Thoughts**: Summarize the primary themes across all notes, emphasizing any particularly interesting or important points by placing them in bold or italics.

Example Output:

---

**Today's To-Do List:**
 - [ ] Item 1
 - [ ] Item 2
 - [ ] Item 3

**Summary of Thoughts:**
- **Major Theme 1**: [Description of the theme and underlying thoughts driving it. Highlight anything intriguing.]
- **Major Theme 2**: [Additional details that reveal this emerging focus. Include any emphasis on what feels noteworthy, using bold for the important phrases].
- **Other Major Theme**: [Further breakdown into additional recurring ideas throughout the notes].

Focus on creating a cohesive narrative from fragmented thoughts, ensuring that important points stand out and actionable items are always clear and attainable.
